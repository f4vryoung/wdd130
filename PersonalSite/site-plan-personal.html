    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>
      This website is primarily targeted towards individuals and families interested in exploring their Utah ancestry but who may lack the time, resources, or expertise to conduct the research themselves. This includes those living outside of Utah, busy professionals, individuals who have “brick wall” research, and those seeking professional assistance in navigating Utah's genealogical records and repositories. The website also aims to reach those looking for document retrieval services specific to Utah.

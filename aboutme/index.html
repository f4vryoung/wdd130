    <h2>Jill Young</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm a resident of South Jordan, Utah, where my little family and I have lived for the past five years. Before that, I grew up and raised my own family in Kearns, Utah. 
        My husband of 27 years manages business intelligence for a health insurance company, my 24-year-old son is training to be a teacher (and moonlights as a scare actor in a 
        haunted house!), and our 20-year-old cat spends her days expressing her displeasure and napping.</p>
    <p>I returned to school to pursue my passion: family history. Discovering the programs at BYU-Pathway and BYU-Idaho was a perfect fit. I've been fascinated by genealogy since 
        childhood, drawn to the puzzle-solving aspect of piecing families together. I've earned two Family History Research certificates, an associate degree in the field, 
        and am now working towards my Bachelor of Professional Studies from BYU-Idaho, while also pursuing genealogy credentials. I'm always looking for opportunities to improve my 
        genealogical skills.</p>
    <p>Outside of family history, I enjoy baking and decorating cakes, crocheting, and reading. My current favorite hobby is collecting and restoring dollhousesâ€”I have over 20 
        unique houses, and I create miniatures for them using clay, 3D printing, and other crafting methods.</p>
    <p>I look forward to learning with and from each of you.</p>
